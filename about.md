## Me in 10 seconds

I have done research in **biophysics**, I investigated the proton pumping mechanism in bacteriorhodopsin[phase separation in proteins](https://www.academia.edu/1107753/Liquid-Liquid_Phase_Separation_in_Protein_Solutions_Controlled_by_Multivalent_Salts_and_Temperature).

Then I moved to neuroscience for some time, I studied signal correlations in the brains of rodents for potential treatment of Parkinson's disease.

I have been a researcher in solid state physics, focusing on graphene as a new nanomaterial and [organic solar cells](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0040609019302780)

Then data engineering.

Then algorithm developer / data science.

Then data engineer and lead in fintech.
