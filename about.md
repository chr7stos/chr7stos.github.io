## Me in 10 seconds

I have been a researcher in biophysics where I studied:
- the proton pumping mechanism of the proteins called bacteriorhodopsins
- liquid-liquid phase separation in protein solutions

Then I moved to neuroscience for some time, I studied signal correlations in the brains of rodents for potential treatment of Parkinson's disease.

Then graphene for new nanomaterials.

Then organic solar cells.    

Then data engineering.

Then algorithm developer / data science.

Then data engineer and lead in fintech.
