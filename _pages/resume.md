I have accumulated approximately a decade's worth of experience working as a data professional. During these 10 years, I have refined my expertise in artificial intelligence, data analytics, product management, and innovation management.

I hold a Ph.D. in Physics from Humboldt University in Berlin, where I delved deep into the realm of nanotechnology for my research. I also have an M.Sci and BA in Natural Science from the University of Cambridge, UK.

My carreer spans a diverse array of industries, including healthcare, mobility/traffic analysis, fintech, and music and entertainment.   Currently I am the Head of Data and Product at Epikast, a healthcare company redefining how biopharma companies engage with patients and healthcare providers.       

I am a fervent advocate for the uptake of technologies such as Artificial Intelligence and Accelerated Computing in business operations, as pivotal tools to optimize workflow efficiencies and drive transformative change. I have a robust portfolio of digitally transformative projects, garnered from my tenure as Industry Programme Manager at The Cyprus Institute and as independent Technology Consultant.      

I am also committed to fostering technology communities. I actively spearhead the PyData Cyprus meetup, driving discussions, innovation, and collaboration among technology enthusiasts and professionals.  Previously, I co-organized various meetups in Berlin, fostering a space for intellectual interaction among like-minded individuals interested in data analytics, open source software, artificial intelligence, product management, and scientific discourse.
