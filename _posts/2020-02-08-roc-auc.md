# Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve

I will make an attempt to explain the concept of ROC curve. I have tried to understand it multiple times, 
reading books and blog posts, but it was hard for the learning to stick.

## What is the ROC curve?
It is a plot showing the true positive rate (TPR) on the y-axis and the false positive rate (FPR) ont he x-axis.    
At various **threshold** settings. The **threshold** is the key word and I believe it was not stressed enough in any other
source I have read about ROC curves.

## What is the threshold?
